~~~if TODO is done set [-] to [+]~~~
========================================
Components:
----------------------------------------
1.thread
[+]get and execute task function
	[+]lock queue
	[+]while no tasks OR tpDestroyNeedsLock==TRUE wait for new task (condition variable)
	[+]dequeue task
	[+]unlock queue
	[+]execute task
[+]implement a function that all thread will execute (that would get and execute tasks forever)
[+]implement a "self destruct" function that would be queued to the tasks 
queue "number_of_threads" times when "tpDestroy" is invoked and would call "exit(0)" 

----------------------------------------
2.task:
[+]implement a struct that would contain a pointer to a function and a the argument to the function 
(this struct would be a member in the task queue)
----------------------------------------
3.functions to implement:
[+]tpInsertTask (NOTE: we need to make sure this function is thread-safe)
	[+]if "tpDestroy was invoked" return -1<==> if sem_getvalue()==0 return -1
	[+]lock queue
	[+]if "tpDestroy was invoked" return -1<==> if sem_getvalue()==0 return -1
	[+]enqueue new task
	[+]cond_signal - wake up one thread to take care of the task
	[+]unlock queue
	[+]return 0
[+]tpDestroy:
	[+]try WAIT destroy-semaphore. if unable return
	[+]tpDestroyNeedsLock=TRUE
	[+]lock queue
	_______________________________
	|(if should NOT WaitForTasks)
	|[+]dequeue all items
	|______________________________
	[+]enqueue "self destruct" function X number of threads
	[+]tpDestroyNeedsLock=FALSE
	[+]cond_broadcast
	[+]unlock queue
	[+]wait for all tasks to be done(with thread id)
	[+]free all allocated memory
	[+]destroy many things...
[+]tpCreate
	[+]allocate memory
	[+]update struct fields
		[+]create an empty queue
		[+]initialize all the locks and condition variables
		[+]array of thread's id's initialization
		[+]other stuff...
		[+]tpDestroyNeedsLock=FALSE
	[+]create all the threads and set them to run the function all threads execute
	[+]return a pointer to the struct

----------------------------------------
additions to struct thread_pool:
[+]tasks queue
[+]lock for tasks queue (probably mutex)
[+]a way to indicate/signal that undone tasks exist (probably condition variable)
[+]int number of requested threads
[+]lock for tpDestroy to be invoked only once (mutex)
[+]semaphore to indicate tpDestroy was invoked
[+]array of thread's id's
[+]bool tpDestroyNeedsLock
========================================
notes:
[+]need to add "#include <pthread.h>" probably to threadPool.h

*remember to compile with "–lpthread"
